Exercise as capstone for the Data Science course (HarvardX PH125.9x).
Written entirely in R.

Prerequisites:
* A subfolder /rda
* **IMPORTANT**. Data files stored in /rda. These are downloaded and cleaned via a script provided by the course, so that script is not included here. Therefore in this folder we expect edx.rda & validation.rda to be present.

Usage:
1. Run the script provided by the course and save the resulting dataframes as edx.rda and validation.rda into /rda
2. Run the script. This will train the recommendation system and store the outcome in a file named "rda/moviePredictor.rda"
3. Knit the .Rmd file to generate the pdf report. This needs the outcome file from above.

Enjoy!
