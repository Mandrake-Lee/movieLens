Exercise as capstone for the Data Science course (HarvardX PH125.9x).
Written entirely in R.
Prerequisites:
* A subfolder /rda
* Data files stored in /rda. These are cleaned via a script provided by the course, so this scrip is not included here. Nonetheless, the files saved as .rda are in this git just for convenience.

Usage:
1. Run the script. This will train the recommendation system and store the outcome in a file named "moviePredictor.rda"
2. Knit the .Rmd file to generate the pdf report. This needs the outcome file from above.

Enjoy!
